Problem statement: Reverse a string

Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input, and returns the string reversed.

Example:
reverseString("Hello World!") should return "!dlroW olleH"

Instructions:

You can assume that the input string will only contain alphabetical characters and whitespace.
Your function should be able to handle strings of any length.

Hints:

You can use the built-in split(), reverse(), and join() functions to help with this problem.
Alternatively, you can use a loop to iterate through the string and build a new reversed string.
